# About 
This project demonstrates the use of a custom annotation to dynamically assign values to a bean variable at runtime, before the Spring application becomes fully operational to handle incoming requests.

## Below is a console screenshot illustrating the sequence of execution:

- Data is inserted into the database.
- The custom annotation retrieves data from the database and assigns it to the corresponding variable.
- The application is initialized and ready to serve incoming traffic.
